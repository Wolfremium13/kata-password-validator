# Password Validator kata

**Objective**
Design and implement software that validates a password using TDD (Test-Driven Development).

The password will be entered by the user (as an argument to the method), and the software should respond whether the password is valid or not.

A valid password must meet the following requirements:

- Have more than 8 characters
- Contain an uppercase letter
- Contain a lowercase letter
- Contain a number
- Contain an underscore

**Technical Requirements:**
We want a method to check if the password is valid or not.
We do not want to know the reason why the password is invalid (the return value is a boolean).
